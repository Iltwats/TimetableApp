## TimeTable App

### Problem Statement:

During my college journey, have heard till now from many students that they have faced this issue of remebering their college schedule, lecture timing and place. But when classes shifted to online they thought this issue they have been facing will be resolved, but it got more complex remembering and managing google meet links, rememebring when you've have classes and when you don't and even our college faculties faced this issue. </p>
Technology plays a vital role in day-to-day life activities which in turn made great changes in many work fields and out of them Mobile Application is one of the major developments, and taking that into consideration I built an android application for my college where students no longer need to remember their dauly schedule whether the classes are offline or online and also can keep track of their assignments, exams schedule and any acdemic events.

### Problem Solution
 In a gist solution I thought was to build:</br>
 `An android app to help students of JECRC University to keep track of their timetables and upcoming academic events`</br>
 In this app students and faculties can add their academic schedule and upcoming events to the application, where they also get notification for their upcoming events 10 minutes before which will solve this comples and lesser thought problem very well.
#### Features: 
- Google Sign in with college email-id to stop spam.
- View academic timetable, upcoming evaluative component and details about classes and other events.
- Can add online meet link to it, so that you need not maintain it
- Notification reminder 10 minutes before each event

 Below are the working screenshots of the application:
